# üå±‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup: Data Collection

This folder contains the code for data collection (i.e., cloning repositories).

## About

The main script for data collection is [`collect_gh_repos.py`](scripts/collect_gh_repos.py).

Refer to `RepoDataCollectionConfig` from [`collect_gh_repos.py`](scripts/collect_gh_repos.py) to tailor the configuration in [collect_gh_repos.yaml](configs/collect_gh_repos.yaml) to your needs, and then run:

```shell
python scripts/collect_gh_repos.py
```
